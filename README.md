# Project: BigARTM Topic Modeling

This project demonstrates the use of BigARTM, a powerful library for topic modeling, to analyze a dataset of text messages. The project involves data preprocessing steps such as removing duplicates, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and filtering stop words before applying the topic modeling algorithm.
Setup and Installation

To get started, several dependencies need to be installed. These include BigARTM and various Python libraries for text processing and data manipulation.

The project includes text preprocessing, model implementation, hierarchical modeling, and result interpretation.
